# Easy Semantic Segmentation using PyTorch

This repository provides an implementation of semantic segmentation using PyTorch. The implementation takes inspiration from the [segmentation-models-pytorch](https://github.com/qubvel/segmentation_models.pytorch) repository by [qubvel](https://github.com/qubvel).

### Environment Setup

Create a virtual environment and install required packages.

```bash
conda create -n semantic-segmentation
conda activate semantic-segmentation
# Check your CUDA version and install PyTorch accordingly.
# In my case, its CUDA 11.7
conda install pytorch torchvision torchaudio pytorch-cuda=11.7 -c pytorch -c nvidia
pip install opencv-python
```

---

### Data Preparation

Datasets like Cityscapes, PASCAL VOC, or COCO can be used. Make sure the dataset is divided into training, validation, and test sets.

---

### Model Architecture

For semantic segmentation, U-Net, SegNet, or DeepLab can be used.

Here's a simple example of U-Net:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class UNet(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        # Initialize layers
```

---

### Training

Train the model using a suitable loss function (e.g., Cross-Entropy loss for segmentation) and optimization algorithm (e.g., Adam).

---

### Evaluation

You can use metrics like IoU (Intersection over Union) to evaluate the model.

---

### Inference

Implement code to run the trained model on new images and visualize the segmentation results.

---

### Documentation

Write a comprehensive README explaining the repository, how to set it up, and how to use it. Also, comment your code adequately.

## Considerations

- **Code Quality**: Make sure the code is modular and well-commented.
- **Efficiency**: Optimize the code for speed and memory.
- **Flexibility**: The code should be easily adaptable for different datasets and models.
